# SPA_Applications


A Single Page Application(SPA) has became the most cutting-Edge technology to build webapplication using javascript framework with angularJS. I was eager to build a spa-application in asp.net core 2 and angularJS frameworks. SPA gives the website users a fluid experience because of the page reload automatically for each generated events.
As you remember I have developed a rest-api application in my previous project called (Rest_API). I have used the same application for database layer, domain models and the repositories. What I added is the SPA-Project into Rest_API project.

Short descriptions for the Clien and server projects.
1. I created a client side application in the ClienApp folder usin Angular 4. Here, I have created a client side model inside app/component folder which contains the properties for server side model.
2. For server side application I created MSControll and UserControll classes to inject our repositories as a dependency, so that we can peform the CRUD operations by invoke the the repositories layer functions.

3. Building a front-end application, I used Angular 4 and Boostrap.
