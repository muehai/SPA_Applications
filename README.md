# Rest_Api
 The purpose of creating this "Rest_Api" application was to demonistrate the .net core 2 platform components to
 build Rest-Api application. What does this application? The application is designed to help manage different meetings. 
 When I decided to build this rest-api solution it shuld be cross-platform, rest architecture principles, separation of concerns principle
 and optimal designed. To achieve all this services I explored the Asp.Net Core 2 and Entity Framework Core 2. For validation I applied 
 FluentValidation library. The appliction folders structure are self explanatory. 
 How to create the Models and Repositories just follow the class libray structures. The rest-api solution will use a single page application (SPA) to render and create dynamic website, but for the moment the SPA solution is not implemented.
